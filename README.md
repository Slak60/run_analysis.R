This program run_analysis does the following steps.
Unzip the file and read each data table.
Then merges the train and test data set to one data set.
Extracted only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurements and created a narrow data set.
It denotes the descriptive activity names to the activities in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the narrow data, it creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject.
